# Frontend-React Rules

## Orchestration
-   **Skill Reference**: Follow `.agent/skills/frontend-react/SKILL.md`.

## Visual Integrity
-   **Canvas**: The 3D view is the "Hero". Do not occlude it with unnecessary UI.
-   **Responsive**: The 3D viewer must work on Mobile (Touch controls).

## Security
-   **Token Storage**: Never store sensitive business logic or pricing data in the Frontend.
-   **Validation**: Frontend validation is for UX only. Backend validation is for Security.
